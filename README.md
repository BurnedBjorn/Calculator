How to use: write your expression (like 2+3) followed by ;, ideal input: 2+3;
to declare variable, write "let <variable name> = <value>;"
variables can be used as numbers after they're declared
you can set value of variable: "<variable name> = <new value>"
runtime errors are possible, it is not very tested.
